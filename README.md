# SM-NT-MapChooser  

The default sourcemod plugin `mapchooser` handles map voting and can be used with the `nominations` and `rockthevote` plugins for more map voting functionality.   

Ideally some of the fixes should be implemented in the official SourceMod plugin but since this is still being worked on slowly, it hasn't been done yet.    

## Versions of the MapChooser plugin for serverops:  

### [New (Default)](https://github.com/bauxiteDYS/SM-NT-MapChooser/blob/new/scripting/nt_mapchooser.sp):  
This is recommended for use, will contain newer changes.  

### [Comp](https://github.com/bauxiteDYS/SM-NT-MapChooser/blob/comp/scripting/nt_mapchooser.sp):  
Use this for competitive servers and will require the [nt_competitive plugin](https://github.com/Rainyan/sourcemod-nt-competitive), ideally versions > 0.6.0.  

### [Old](https://github.com/bauxiteDYS/SM-NT-MapChooser/blob/old/scripting/nt_mapchooser.sp):  
The original modification that makes the Mapchooser work with NT, you can use this if you want, however `new` branch is recommended.  

### [Other](https://github.com/bauxiteDYS/SM-NT-MapChooser/blob/Other/scripting/nt_mapchooser.sp):  
Other experimental changes.
